# Concept-of-a-Portable-Covid-19-Diagnosis-Kit
A possible design for CRISPR-based corona detection kit which people could use at home

Portable Covid-19 diagnosis kits help control the spread of the virus
STOPCovid technology is designed for laboratory use
Certain factors make them impractical for portable use

- Reagents stored at -20o C 
- RNA amplification requires incubation of samples at 60o C. 
- Mixing needs pipettes
- Need detection strips (detection device)
- Contamination risk

Following shows example of STOPCovid kit

I would like to use following technology that overcomes limitations of the STOPCovid. 



* Uses lyophilized powder – storage of reagent in RT is enabled.
* Hot pack – used to sustain critical temperature at 60o C. 
* Do-it-yourself (DIY) mask pack/Microfluidics design – No pipettes, resolving possible contamination issues
* Uses Smart Hydrogel Technology – no need for detection strips (detection device) – positive or negative result
